# Classifiers
The "Bank Marketing Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). You can find a description of the attributes at the original UCI URL, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.

In this project, three classifiers were built for this data set: a decision tree, a naive Bayesian classifier, and a support vector machine. 10-fold cross validation was done to evaluate classifier.
